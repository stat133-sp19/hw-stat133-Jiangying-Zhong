**Euclidean Distance**
*Definition*
The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them $\\bf\\bar{pq}$. In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..,*p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in the distance(d) from **p** to **q**,or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:
The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector.So **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors,starting from the origin of the space(initial point) with their tips(terminal points)ending at the two points.The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vectormeasures the length of the vector.
where the last expression involves the dot product.
