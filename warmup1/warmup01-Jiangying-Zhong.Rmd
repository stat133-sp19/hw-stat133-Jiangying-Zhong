**Euclidean Distance**\
*Definition*\

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them $\bf\bar{pq}$.
In Cartesian coordinates, if $\textbf{p} = (p_1,p_2,..,p_n)$ and $\textbf{q} = (q_1,q_2,...,q_n)$ are two points in the distance(d) from $\textbf{p}$ to $\textbf{q}$,or from $\textbf{q}$ to $\textbf{p}$ is given by the Pythagorean formula:
\begin{equation}
d(p,q)=d(q,p)=\sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2+(q_2-p_2)^2+\underbrace{\cdots}_{\rm cdots}+(q_n-p_n)^2}=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(q_i-p_i)^2}
\end{equation}
The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector.So **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors,starting from the origin of the space(initial point) with their tips(terminal points)ending at the two points.The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vectormeasures the length of the vector.
\begin{equation}
||p||=\sqrt{p_1^2+p_2^2+\underbrace{\cdots}_{\rm cdots}+p_n^2}=\sqrt{p*p}
\end{equation}
where the last expression involves the dot product.
